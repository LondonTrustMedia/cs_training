## Welcome to PIA

Welcome! We're Private Internet Access. We protect people online.

As part of the PIA support team, we help our customers use our service and work to make sure our customers' communications are as safe as they can be.

This site should get you introduced to us, what we do, and help you provide the best possible support to our users. Each page can be printed and it's designed to let you run through at your own pace. If you find any issues with the site, feel free to reach out to `@doaks` so we can fix them up!

Let's go over some basics.


## What is PIA?

A VPN makes sure that your ISP can't see what you're doing on the internet, and that your traffic can't be traced back to you directly. That is, it stops them from monitoring the webpages you visit, the sites you read, the images/videos you look at and similar.

We provide a VPN service that lets our users protect what they're doing online and stay safe, secure and private.


## Our Users

We're the largest VPN provider out there. As such, lots of people around the world use our service.

Our users range from very technical folk to people who had our service setup for them by their kids. The people that use our service are all ages, and have all sorts of different skill levels.

The main thing that's consistent between all our users is that all of them want a fast, private, and secure connection to the internet. They want to make sure that nothing's watching and recording what they do online – from their ISP, to their government, their employer, and even us!

We exist to make sure that our users' traffic is safe.


## Support

We fix problems, answer questions and resolve queries that customers bring our way. As the support department, we're the first face that customers see (and in most cases, the only people they talk to).

As the public face of PIA, we need to make sure that what we say is accurate, friendly, and that we resolve the issues brought to us fairly quickly. Avoiding a bunch of back-and-forth by simply providing the correct information or fixing their issues straight-up is the best way to help out our users, and is what we strive to do.

Our main website is [www.privateinternetaccess.com](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) and our support site is [helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com](https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/hc/en-us).


## Services

We have a number of tools that help us provide support. In no particular order, those include:

- [Google]({{site.baseurl}}/services/google.html), for sharing files and providing our emails.
- [Slack]({{site.baseurl}}/services/slack.html), for talking between and within the support department.
- [Zendesk]({{site.baseurl}}/services/zendesk.html), for receiving incoming queries and responding to them.

As well as these, we also have some internal services we provide so we can do our job. These are the [Support Tool]({{site.baseurl}}/internal/support.html) and the [Fraud Tool]({{site.baseurl}}/internal/fraud.html).

Getting to know how each of these works is very useful in making sure you can effectively solve customer issues.


## Getting Started

When you get started with PIA, you'll be provided with a few things. Those are:

- PIA email address (ex: doaks@privateinternetaccess.com).
- Slack account.
- Zendesk account.
- Support Tool login.

Once you pop in and join Slack you should be added to all the right channels, and be free to see how we operate over here!

The local trainer should be able to go through the basics of PIA, the services above, and general customer service before moving into training around particular areas such as Accounts, Payments and Tech. This is where reading this site really comes in handy, and can help you get your bearings around here.

Once you're relatively trained-up you'll be presented with Zendesk, and be able to start looking at actual customer queries! With help, you'll read through tickets carefully, figure out the best way to respond and start helping our customers.

When we're confident in your abilities, you'll be able to join our team as a full agent and be able to help out our customers on your own.

If you do encounter any sort of trouble, take a look through this site and see whether we've already got any advice on it. Otherwise, you can reach out to your trainer, supervisor or coworkers for help. Above almost all else, we prefer providing accurate and useful info to our users.
