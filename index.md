## Welcome!

Hi! This website contains general training and info about PIA, useful for those working with us with support.

The tabs on the left link to specific sections/articles. If there's a video to go along with a specific article, it will be displayed at the start of that article.

If you'd like to have a physical copy to go through, all articles are printable.


### Self-Paced Training

There are training classes run with this material, but you can also visit this site anytime you want a refresher on a specific topic. If you intend to spend a decent amount of time reviewing some topics, simply let your supervisor know so they can plan accordingly.


### Issues, Bugs and Problems, Oh My!

You may find issues with this site, the linked videos, or the content on here. Stuff may be unclear, there may be spelling mistakes or just information that's plain wrong.

If you do see any issues like this, please reach out to your supervisor or the support managers so that these issues can be corrected!
