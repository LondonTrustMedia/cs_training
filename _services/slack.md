We use Slack within PIA to communicate within and between teams.

There are specific channels for each tier (and for Tier 2, specific channels for Tech/Account/Billing), as well as ones dedicated to training/review, social media queries, incoming media queries and similar.

When you're brought onto the team, you'll be introduced to the channels that we think you'll need. As a general rule, try not to tell people the other specific channels you're joined to, particularly if they don't have access to those channels.  This applies especially for managers, supervisors and people in similar more privilidged or specific roles.
