Welcome to PIA! Whether you're new or just reviewing, this should help you understand who we are, what we do, and how to get started with us.


## Private Internet Access

Essentially, we help protect people online. We're a VPN provider, which means that people use our service to prevent their ISP from capturing their traffic, and stop the people they're talking to from getting their IP address.

Our users range from very technical folk to people who simply transparently use our service through a router that their kids setup. As such, we need to be adept at talking to users of all experience levels.

Our main website is [www.privateinternetaccess.com](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) and our support site is [helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com](https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/hc/en-us).


## Support

As the support department, our job is to fix problems. That is, to help resolve issues that customers are having with our service, and respond to questions or queries they have about us.

Most of our job relies on working in tickets with customers, using Zendesk. We use Slack for interpersonal communication and LastPass to distribute required information between teams. In addition, we use some internal sites to perform support actions, such as fraud lookups and general account maintenence.


## Onboarding

When you're getting introduced here, we'll give you access to a suite of tools that include:

- [Google]({{site.baseurl}}/services/google.html)
- [Zendesk]({{site.baseurl}}/services/zendesk.html)
- [Slack]({{site.baseurl}}/services/slack.html)
- [LastPass]({{site.baseurl}}/services/lastpass.html)
- [Support Tool]({{site.baseurl}}/internal/support.html) (internal)
- [Fraud Tool]({{site.baseurl}}/internal/fraud.html) (internal)

Each page explains how to start using it and what we use it for.
