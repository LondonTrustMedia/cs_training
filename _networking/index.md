What is networking? Networking is essentially a way to transfer data between different computers and devices.

Our app and our service builds on top of I.T. networking -- as such, having a working knowledge of networking is invaluable when it comes to figuring out solutions, discovering issues, and suggesting fixes to customers.

This section goes through networking from start to finish. There's a lot of detail in here and you're not expected to know every line. This page should help you figure out exactly what you _need_ to know, what'll help you day-to-day and what you don't need to dig too in-depth into.


## Need-to-know

These are the core, foundational things that you should have a decent working knowledge of, and should be really helpful in your day-to-day problem solving:

1. [Packet Switching]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/packet-switching.html).
2. [IP (Internet Protocol)]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/ip.html).
3. [UDP and TCP]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/udptcp.html).
4. [DNS]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/dns.html).
5. [Speed and Connection Issues]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/connection_issues.html).
6. [MTR Tests]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/mtr.html).

These are ares that help you understand how VPN technology itself works, so you should make sure to study up on these (and let us know if you want some additional training around them).


## Good-to-know

These areas are also useful to know, and should help you quite a bit. They do draw on other knowledge and other articles, but hopefully you should be able to go through them without too much trouble regardless.

1. [Binary and Number Systems]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/binary.html).
2. [IPs and Subnets]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/ipsandsubnets.html).
3. [Switching]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/switching.html).
4. [Routing]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/routing.html).

If you run into any issues with these, please let us know and we can adjust our training to be more useful!


## Extra Credit

These can help you more fully understand how other areas work. For instance, knowing how Switching and Routing works helps immensely when understanding some of the more complex speed/connection issues we talk about. You should look at these, see what you can pick up and how far you can go through them.

1. [NAT]({{site.baseurl}}/networking/nat.html).

These extra-credit sections are strange most of them help you understand those 'good-to-know' articles and areas above. I'd recommend digging into them and seeing how far you can get. If you need to come back to them later, you can always skip back and forth through the sections to get a more complete understanding of it all.


## Overview

These sections are written in the order they're listed in the navigation bar. I think going through them in that order should explain it the best but you're free to skip back and forth, read in-depth into specific areas and more skim over others that aren't as useful.

Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of how you can go through the training here, and what you should focus on.

The important thing to know is: You can take it one step at a time. You can read one section, dig into that for a while and make sure you understand it before moving on to the next. If you run into troubles, feel free to talk to us -- we're glad to help you learn, understand, or simply review any areas you have trouble with.

And as always, if there are any issues with our training or you have suggestions, feel free to reach out to myself (doaks) anytime.
