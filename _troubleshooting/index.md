Troubleshooting is the act of seeing an issue, finding the cause of it, and fixing it. We do a lot of that.

There are lots of ways to approach troubleshooting systems, and this section goes through the ways I've found most useful. We go through generic troubleshooting, and then tips on how to troubleshoot specific kinds of applications, devices and processes.

This section goes through troubleshooting from start to finish, and should contain a fair amount of useful information for you to look at.

## Need-to-know

Here are the core, fundamental things you need to know about troubleshooting, and will be very helpful in your day-to-day work:

1. [Generic Troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/troubleshooting/generic.html) deals with the fundamentals of how to troubleshoot any sort of system, from your car, to a phone, to a VPN connection.


## Overview

These sections are written in the order they're listed in the navigation bar. I think going through them in that order should explain it the best but you're free to skip back and forth, read in-depth into specific areas and more skim over others that aren't as useful.

Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of how you can go through the training here, and what you should focus on.

The important thing to know is: You can take it one step at a time. You can read one section, dig into that for a while and make sure you understand it before moving on to the next. If you run into troubles, feel free to talk to us -- we're glad to help you learn, understand, or simply review any areas you have trouble with.

And as always, if there are any issues with our training or you have suggestions, feel free to reach out to myself (doaks) anytime.
