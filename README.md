## Converting Videos

To convert videos to mkv/mp4, I recommend using [Handbreak](https://handbrake.fr). It's a free, open-source video converter that just works brilliantly.


## Preparing

So to get this repo ready (to start testing/building it), do this:

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
2. Copy the videos folder into this repo as `./videos/`.

And afterwards, do one of the following so you can actually use it.


### Build Instructions

1. `jekyll build`
2. Your built site is in `./_site/`.


### Development Instructions

1. `jekyll serve -w`
2. Head to http://localhost:4000/ss/
