Being able to look at a query from someone and respond to it appropriately is everything that we do. We're the support team, and our job is to support and provide good service to our users. Customer Service is vital in what we do, and this section helps go through exactly how to best respond to customers

In [Approaching a Query]({{ site.baseurl }}/cs/approach.html), we see the first steps to take when looking at an incoming query. We sort it out by the sort of query it is, and give some example responses that can go along with them.

In [Writing a Response]({{ site.baseurl }}/cs/responding.html), we take a closer look at how to go about writing a response to a query. This includes what makes a good response, things to avoid, and tips that can really help make your responses stellar.
