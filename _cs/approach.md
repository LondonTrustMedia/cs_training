title: Approaching a Query
order: 1
---
So you've opened a ticket, what's the first step? Well, the first step is to see exactly what sort of query it is.

In general, there are a few separate kinds of queries that we receive:

- **Feedback:** These customers are letting us know that we're doing a good (or not so good) job.
- **Notes:** These are just things that customers think we should know about. An issue they've seen (that they're not interested in troubleshooting), a blog post that's come out and we might want to look at, etc.
- **Support Queries:** These customers are having trouble getting our service to work.

It's useful to know how to respond to each of these when we see them. For some of them posting a response of basically just "Thanks!" is appropriate, and for others starting troubleshooting is most useful. 

Let's go through each type of query and how to approach it generally.


## Feedback

We often get positive and negative feedback from our customers. Sometimes it's appropriate to start troubleshooting with them, sometimes it's best to just let them know that we've taken their points into account, and sometimes it can be best to say _"Thanks for the support!"_ and leave it there. Let's get into the specific types of feedback and things to keep in mind.

### Positive Feedback

When someone tells us we're doing a good job, it's good to say thanks! When looking at things like a Twitter response, just liking their tweet can be enough. However, especially with tickets, it's a good idea to say thanks to the customers that go out of their way to tell us we're doing a good job.

Something to keep an eye out for is the more subtle requests for troubleshooting. A response like this may indicate that the user's looking for someone to help them out with a specific issue:

> Hi PIA!
>
> I'm glad about that blog post you put out, it's really good to see that you're helping the EFF fight this issue and protect our privacy!
>
> As an aside, one thing I've seen on my system is that I can't connect to U.S. West properly, weird lol.
>
> Have a nice day,
>
> Jerry

In a case like this, Jerry isn't asking for help, he's more just mentioning the trouble. When we see this, it's best to say thanks for the support, and to ask whether he would like our help to figure out what's going on with it.

---

Here's an example of a good response (that I might send myself):

> Hi Jerry,
>
> Thanks for the support! We do our best to help out our friends at the EFF when we're able.
>
> You mentioned not being able to connect to U.S. West, would you like to do some troubleshooting with us and find out what's going on there?
>
> Regards,

This response is good because it asks whether they want to go down this road, or whether they just want to continue on as they are. In the original email, Jerry doesn't seem too fussed with the problem so it's good to ask.

In addition, our response here lets him know that he'll need to do work to discover what's going on, by focusing on the fact that he'll need to work to troubleshoot it with our help (i.e. _"would you like to do some troubleshooting with us"_ makes it clear that he'll need to do work). If we went with something more like _"would you like us to troubleshoot this for you?"_ it would put along the incorrect idea that he'd not need to do anything to help figure it out, and could end with him agreeing and getting frustrated when we ask him to go through steps.

---

Here's an example of a response that I'd **avoid:**

> Hi Jerry,
>
> If you'd like to continue troubleshooting this, please send us these details:
>
> - Which device you're using the VPN on.
> - Your OS.
> - Whether you're encountering the issue after switching ports from Auto to TCP, 443 8080 or 80.
> - Are you using antivirus?
> - Are you using a password manager if you're on Android?
>
> Regards,

This response is **bad** for a few reasons:

1. It totally disregards the appreciation that they showed us – this makes us look like we don't care.
2. It jumps right into troubleshooting, which probably comes as a shock to them given how they presented the issue in their initial email.
3. Aside from just surprising them, it asks for so much information which could overwhelms them. Answering _"Which device are you using this on?"_ or a lot easier than answering a stock list of questions. 
4. This list of questions comes across as a stock list that's sent to everyone, rather than a response actually designed for them. This makes PIA appear more like a large, faceless company (that's responded with an autoresponder) than a company that actually cares about resolving the issues that they're having.

In this situation, this sort of response is awful and is something I'd be pretty unhappy about seeing. Something akin to the above – thanking the user and then asking whether they want to continue, is much more appropriate.

---

In a more general, just supportive comment, it can be difficult to work out how to respond just due to how little they send us. Occasionally, we'll get an email like this:

> Yeeeah!
>
> -Wilson

With this query, it's not too clear what Wilson's referring to. At all.

This is something where it's best to keep our response more shallow. I'd usually go with something like this:

> Hi Wilson,
>
> Thanks for the support! Is there anything we can help you with today?
>
> Regards,

This is short, sweet, and very quickly asks whether they have any troubles. If they do, they can go into them – and if they don't, they can respond with a _"Nope, that's all thanks!"_ and we can leave it at that.


### Negative Feedback

Maybe we messed up with an update. Maybe a single server went down. Maybe we just provided not-great customer support. Regardless of why, negative feedback is something that we're going to receive. Knowing how to respond to it is really useful.

This sort of feedback is difficult to respond to because usually the user on the other side of the screen starts off being irritated, annoyed, and generally just not very happy. Whether it's warranted or not, our job is to do the best we can to placate them and resolve their issue. This is especially important when we get negative feedback since irritated customers like to post the responses they get to social media (and if that response isn't well-constructed, we'll get torn to shreds over it).

With a response to a negative query, the most important thing is to placate the user, and then to fix their issue. Fixing their issue is necessary, and making them feel placated can prevent them from posting their issue publicly and similarly from just thinking that we're bad in general.

Here's an example of some negative feedback:

> Your service f&$?ing sucks, f$%k you and f%$k your software!
>
> It won't even install properly on my iphone, what sort of stupid scam are you running?

Now, this customer's obviously not that happy with us. It sounds like the main problem is that they're not able to install our software properly.

Responding to a customer like this is always a bit of a gamble, since we could always make them less angry, or just more angry.

---

Here's an example of a good response to this:

> Hi,
>
> I'm very sorry to hear about the trouble you're having with our service! Would you like to try some troubleshooting to get your connection working with us?
>
> It sounds like the app's not installing properly on your phone. We've got a setup here that uses an alternate connection method, which you may wish to try instead: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/ios-openvpn-connect
>
> Please let us know whether you'd like to continue troubleshooting, and whether that setup is useful.
>
> Regards,

This response is good because:

1. It says **"I'm sorry"**, not **"We're sorry"**. Using direct, personal language makes them feel like there's a person on the other end, and that person actually cares. Saying _"We're sorry"_ comes across as weak, and makes people feel like there's customer service representative number 245 on the other end who doesn't care, and just palms them off to the company.
2. It asks whether or not they'd like to continue. This is good to do because there are some users who'll just say that nah they don't want to – and even if they do want to continue, it makes them feel like they have some control in the interaction and where it goes, putting us on a good first foot.
3. We give them somewhere to go on their own. You might not always be able to do this, but in this case they specifically said "iPhone", which means we can go off that. Letting them try out those steps themselves, particularly since they're linked on a different page, lets them give those a shot and maybe calm down a bit before writing their response.
4. It's short. There's not paragraph after paragraph of stock-standard (what feels like just copypasted/automated) steps to follow. This is another reason for including the link to those steps, rather than pasting those steps directly into our response.

---

Here's a response that does a pretty poor job of helping this customer:

> Hi.
>
> We're sorry that you're encountering this issue.
>
> If you'd like to continue troubleshooting this, please send us these details:
>
> - Which device you're using the VPN on.
> - Your OS.
> - Whether you're encountering the issue after switching ports from Auto to TCP, 443 8080 or 80.
> - Are you using antivirus?
> - Are you using a password manager if you're on Android?
>
> Thanks,

This response is, plainly, awful. If this got posted publicly as a response to the above, we would be skewered for it.

Let's go through some specific points about why this response isn't good:

1. Instead of **"Hi,"** with a comma, it's **"Hi."** with a fullstop. This can come off as passive-aggressive, and just isn't good form for this sort of formal response.
2. It says **"We're sorry"**, which comes off as weak. It feels like it's a copypasted response, and not something written by a human who actually cares about whether they're having this issue or not.
3. It throws them a list of questions! They're annoyed, they're angry, and they're never going to gladly answer a list of questions for us in the state they're in. This is more likely than not to just make them want to send back a response saying _"Refund me now"_.
4. Even if the questions could be followed, it very clearly asks _"Which device are you using?"_. In his query, it clearly says _"iPhone"_, which also makes the OS question useless (maybe OS version, but the operating system is iOS). As well, the question around whether the port switching helps isn't useful because he says that he can't actually install the app at all, not that he's having trouble connecting.
5. Saying **"Thanks,"** at the end here is a bit of a misstep. It's not as bad as the things above, but it's the wrong ending to a response where we're saying sorry. Saying **"Regards,"** as done above is appropriate pretty much always, and you don't run into this sort of clash of feelings, where the letter's saying sorry and the ending is more of a cheery, lighthearted response.

While this response might start helping to resolve their issue, it does nothing to placate them. And even then, it does very poorly at the resolving issue as well. If I saw this response to the original query, I'd be pretty disappointed.

---

Here's a similar, almost minimal example of some negative feedback:

> Y'all f&%king suck
>
> -Brian

If we see something like this, the first step is to take a look at their older tickets to see whether we can see any reason why they might be irritated. At the same time, we can look in the support tool to see the same. For instance, maybe their last ticket was three days ago and ended up with us giving them some steps to fix the connection on their Windows machine, or maybe we look in our support tool and see that three password resets were recently performed.

Similar to the last minimal example, it's good to keep the response short where we can, but addressing those possible concerns can be good as well.

---

Here's an example response I might give if I find that they did have a Windows ticket very recently:

> Hi Brian,
>
> I'm very sorry to hear this. Are you having any issues with your Windows setup that we can help with?
>
> Regards,

I think this sort of response is short, sweet, hits the major points and doesn't leave a lot of room for misinterpretation and similar.

---

Here's an example response I'd give if I didn't see anything relevant in the history for this customer:

> Hi Brian,
>
> I'm very sorry to hear this. If there anything we can help you with today?
>
> Regards,

A response along these lines works fine. There's nothing else for us to go on based off the information we have, so it's the best we can do.


## Notes

Notes are sorta like feedback, but I tend to separate the two by:

1. The amount of information the user's providing us. With notes, they're telling us something specific.
2. Whether they want to be contacted about it again. Typically with notes, no contact / troubleshooting / etc is desired.

It's good to be able to spot when something's feedback that they may want a troubleshooting response to, and when they just want to put along some details, results or queries to us.

Why do we get notes? Well, our product's very technical, our users can be extremely technical, and PIA is a part of the security industry. Because of all this, we can get quite technical users passing us useful information with no real need to troubleshoot or resolve anything directly with them.

---

As an example, here's a technical note that we could receive:

> Hey PIA,
>
> The encryption key used for your Blowfish mode isn't rotated enough to prevent SWEET32 completely, you should change that. [https://example.com/article-about-encryption-modes](#)
>
> P. Rizolli
>
> SafeCorp

In this example, P. Rizolli is passing along a possible vulnerability. This is something that should be passed to T2, then either to QA or to management directly to deal with.

At the same time, responding appropriately while we take a look at this is good. He's not asking for help or to actually resolve anything, so just letting him know that we have the feedback and are acting on it.

---

I'd go with something like this:

> Hi P. Rizolli,
>
> Thank you very much for sending this to us! I'm passing this information to the relevant team so that we can take a closer look at this.
>
> Is there anything else we can help you with today?
>
> Regards,

This response is good for a few reasons:

1. It comes out and thanks them for sending this info along. Getting notes like this helps us out, and tells us where to look for things like new features, possible issues and the like.
2. We say that we're passing the info along to the team for evaluation. They know that we're looking at it and they don't end up thinking that we're just blowing them off.
3. It doesn't come out and say we'll give them an update, or provide them with more info when we have it. This means that we're tracking less customer queries, which is good. If they want an update or to be notified, they'll come back and let us know that they want those things. Assuming off the bat that they don't want to be contacted again (for a query like this) is fine.
4. Asking if that's all helps them control the conversation, and say either yeah that's all (we can leave it) or no there's more stuff (we may need to give them updates and all).

All in all, it conveys that we care about what they're bringing to us, we're looking at it appropriately, and that we're thankful. It's short but it does the job, and if they want more info, updates or assurances, they'll let us know.

---

Here's another less-positive note:

> Hello PIA,
>
> The forum doesn't work. The CSS on the profile page here makes it look really bad and tall for no reason:
> [https://example.com/forum/profile/51423](#)
>
> Fix it.

This one's a bit harder to respond to, since it comes from a more negative angle. But we can do it without much of a problem.

---

Here's how I could respond to that:

> Hello,
>
> I'm very sorry for this trouble here! I'll pass this along to our web team so they can take a closer look at this.
>
> Is there anything else we can help you with today?
>
> Regards

Some points to keep in mind about this response: 

1. I don't include a name on the response (just leave it at _"Hello,"_) because they don't give me one. I avoid 'Hi' in this instance because it looks a bit short and strange on a line of its' own.
2. We say sorry for the issue, since it sounds like they're not too happy.
3. Simply, we say we're passing it to the web team to take a look at.
4. Asking whether there's anything else we can help them with is a nice way to end, since otherwise the response just kinda ends on _"Okay thanks"_ with no real finality.

For this, I'd say that a response along these lines is fine.


## Support Queries

We get support queries when our users are having issues. They make up most of our incoming support traffic, and it's vital to know how to respond appropriately to them.

When we get support queries, our number one goal is to **get it working** for them. Not to push the use of our app of OpenVPN, not to talk about the numerous reasons to use VPNs, not to upsell or placate them, but to **get their system working and connected to our network**. Of course, working to placate them can always help, particularly if their experience hasn't been great or they're irritated. However, if we get their issue solved quickly and efficiently it'll do a world more good than paragraphs of placation ever could.


### Reading

When you approach a support query, whether it's their first message to us or there's been a bunch of back-and-forths with agents, there's one thing you need to do:

<span class="blink" style="color: #d25; font-size: 2.5em; font-weight: bold">Read everything in the ticket.</span>

<span class="hideprinted">Sorry for the blinking text, but this</span><span class="hidescreen">This</span> is **the most important thing** for you to do when approaching a ticket.

Reading the ticket and whole chain of replies from earliest to latest:

- Lets you see exactly what's been tried before to fix their issue.
- Gives you access to _all_ the information that the user's thrown our way, and all the issues they've encountered.
- Makes the user feel like they're talking to a team that works together, rather than three separate 'customer service representatives' that each have the memory of a goldfish.

If you read the ticket, you have the info to give good results. If you quickly skim the ticket you'll miss a lot of useful information. And if you don't read at all... well, the only thing that you're going to do is make the customer more irritated with us and with our service. Skimming is honestly likely to do the same. Take a moment and give the ticket a decent read before you think about how to best respond to it.


### What's The Problem?

After reading the ticket, the first question you should ask yourself is: _"What issues are they having?"_

That is, what is it that they actually want to accomplish, and can't. Often, users explain things in convoluded ways, and even we as customer support agents can too. Often, I've seen the customer refer to issue X causing issue Y, and an agent reply with how to fix issue Y without thinking about or looking at the actual root problem they're having.

If you read the ticket from the start, you can sometimes see that the problem(s) that they're having change across the ticket – some get solved halfway through, and others pop up as a result of changes made during the troubleshooting. With particularly complex tickets I actually grab a piece of paper, note down each issue while I'm reading, and then mark them off as they get resolved. Once I'm finished, I have a good list of issues which aren't resolved and the customer wants fixed.

Once you know what the problem is, you'll know whether you have the skills and expertise to solve it yourself, whether a coworker can help give you some guidance, or whether it should go to a different tier.


### Troubleshooting and Root Cause

Once you know that you should be looking at it, we come to troubleshooting and root causes.

When you have an issue, the general process to resolving it is:

1. See that the issue's happening.
2. Gather and read through information about issue.
3. Find a possible root cause for the issue.
4. Solve that root cause.
5. Check whether the issue's resolved.
    1. If it isn't resolved, go back to step 2.
6. Issue is resolved!

The exact process you go through changes depending on the sort of ticket it is, but the process of troubleshooting is very useful to know. If you know how to troubleshoot, you'll be able to approach almost any issue that comes your way, given you have the right background knowledge.

The above should give you a good place to start, but for more information on exactly how to troubleshoot, we've got a generic troubleshooting section in the Tech training, which you can find [here]({{site.baseurl}}/tech/troubleshooting/generic.html). It does use some more technical terms, but reading through this page will help you understand what troubleshooting really involves, and how you can use it effectively.

Through troubleshooting, and possibly some written-up steps for solving common issues, you should know what to suggest to the user. Explaining why we're asking them to provide more information, perform a task, or otherwise help us out lets them understand our thought process, and makes it easier for them to agree to go along with us.


### Writing The Response

You know what issues they're facing. You know the solutions you want to try. You know **why** you're suggesting these solutions (this is vital). So, how do you take it from here?

Plain and simple, you write up a response that addresses each of the issues they're still having, goes through each solution you want to present, and finishes off.

---

Let's say that we have a user who's having trouble logging into their account. You take a look and see that he's had three password resets performed in the past couple years. Each time, we've reset his password and he's happy.

Sounds simple, right? Well, let's get to writing that response then!

> Hi Roger,
>
> I'm sorry to hear that your password doesn't work. Would you like us to perform a password reset for you? This'll give you a new password and make sure you've got the right one.
>
> Please keep in mind that you may need to login again on your devices if we change your password.
>
> Regards,

Here are the points I think are worth mentioning here:

1. _"**I'm** sorry to hear that it doesn't work."_ That's _"I"_, rather than _"We"_. Taking personal responsibility makes it feel more genuine, even if it's a little thing on our side.
2. _"I'm sorry to hear that it doesn't work."_ This is good because both not knowing your correct password, and having to do a password reset suck. Hearing sorry helps soften the blow a bit.
3. _"Would you like us to..."_ We ask whether they'd like to reset the password. Particularly as password resets can involve a bit of rigmarole, updating other devices and all, it's very good to ask before we put them through that. In this case, it also lets them put off the reset for a couple days 'til they're fine to do so. As well, asking helps put them in control of where to take the query, and makes them feel more involved in the process.
4. _"This'll give you a new password and make sure you've got the right one."_ Plainly, this is just explaining why we're doing it. Helps them see why we're wanting to perform the rest.
5. _"Please keep in mind that..."_ This sentence just conveys to the user that there's gonna be some work. If they're logged in already, they'll need to login again once we change their password. This helps prevent surprises and unexpected frustration later on.

All-in-all this is a workable response, and probably the best we can give. Asking before we do is very important here, and if we flat-out just reset the password it could result in some very unexpected additional failures on the user's side (which would just make our job more difficult).

---

Here's an example of a response to this situation that disregards the above advice:

> Hi Roger!
>
> I've reset your password. You should receive the new one in an email and be able to see it.
>
> Regards,

Here's some specific points on this response:

1. _"Hi Roger!"_ An exclamation mark sounds really strange there. It's a little jarring and inconsistent with the tone we should be taking. This makes it seem like we don't really care about (or at taking really lightheartedly) what is a pretty serious issue to the user.
2. _"I've reset your password."_ In the case where the password is incorrect, a reset usually needs to happen. However, doing it out-of-the-blue like this can cause many issues. For instance, they could've been using our app just find on their iPad or iPhone, but when we reset the password it just flat-out starts failing to connect. And they have no clue why until they check our email. This makes them understandable pretty frustrated with us.
3. We don't say sorry, or anything even roughly seem apologetic. The simple fact is that it's easy to throw in a single line saying so, as we've done above, and help placate them.

That's why I wouldn't like to send this response off-the-bat. Where this response would work pretty well would be after they see that first response and come back to us with "Yes, please reset my password". If after resetting the password we sent this response, it fits well (I'd just add a line asking them to tell us how it goes and whether the new details work for them).


## Overview

So essentially, when you look at a query you need to see exactly what sort of query it is. Are they:

- Just complimenting us?
- Giving us a note to act on / some advice?
- Asking us a question?
- Having trouble?

Once we know what they're looking for, we can respond appropriately. (As noted above, if they're just giving us some advice then jumping right into troubleshooting isn't gonna go down well)

For compliments or notes/advice, usually we can thank them, ask if there's anything else we can help them with, and move on.

For questions, we can just do our best to answer the question properly.

And for trouble, we can start troubleshooting.

---

Generally, a good troubleshooting process to go through is to:

1. See that the issue's happening.
2. Gather and read through information about issue.
3. Find a possible root cause for the issue.
4. Solve that root cause.
5. Check whether the issue's resolved.
    1. If it isn't resolved, go back to step 2.
6. Issue is resolved!

And some more specifics on troubleshooting can be found [on this page]({{site.baseurl}}/tech/troubleshooting/generic.html).
