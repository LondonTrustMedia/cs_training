What makes a good customer service response? Generally, things that just make good emails and messages.

We'll go through some things to keep in mind when writing all responses. After that, we'll move onto specific types of responses, and what to look at when responding on different mediums.


## Good Response Attributes

Regardless of what you're responding to, your response needs to have:

- **Good Spelling And Grammar**
- **Care**
- **Accuracy**

Let's go over each of these in some more detail, and what you can do to make sure you get each of these points right!

### Good Spelling And Grammar

People expect good spelling/grammar when they talk to customer service, so lacking this is what really causes issues. If we have bad spelling/grammar, it puts forward the messages that we're not smart, that we don't care, and as a result we can't help with their query.

Your browser may be able to spellcheck for you automatically. However, if you have any doubts Google the word and see whether it's corrected there.

Grammar is more difficult to teach in-depth, so I'll point you towards a few external resources you can look through:

This is particularly important for public responses. If you're writing social media responses, make sure you have strong spelling and grammar skills.

### Caring

Put simply, we need to care about our users and about getting their issues resolved. People can generally tell when we don't care, and if they feel like we don't care then there's no reason for them to continue with us or using our services.

There are a few ways we can help our responses feel more authentic, and like we care more. First off, take personal responsibility in responses. i.e. try to use _"I"_ rather than _"We"_. If you say _"We are sorry"_, you're telling them that they're talking to a company. If you say _"I'm sorry"_, it says that they're talking to another real person.

When looking at a query, really read through what they've said so far and nail down exactly what they're bringing to us. If they're bringing a concern about encryption to us, make sure we answer that. If they're asking about our payment methods when they use a VPN, make sure we answer specifically about our payment methods when they use a VPN. If we get this wrong, we don't answer what they're actually asking and it really feels like we don't care about trying to help them.

### Accuracy

We put forth suggestions on how to resolve issues and answers to queries people send us. We need to make sure that our answers are accurate through training, testing it yourself, or by getting information from your coworkers that they know is accurate.

When you have a solution to a user's problem, or an answer to their question, ask yourself "How do I know that this is right?" Is it through having tested and confirmed it yourself, getting the information from someone who does concretely know, a guess based on your experience and your expectations, or simply a guess?

If you're not sure about how accurate a solution is, you should get confirmation or get something that is more accurate. However, if you do need to suggest solutions you're not totally sure of, you can use phrases like _"It may be worth trying..."_ or _"I'd suggest looking at..."_. You can also simply say, _"I'd like to try something to see whether it resolves this issue. Could I please ask you to..."_.

An example of what not to say is _"Do this to resolve this issue"_, or simply providing the solution with no mention of the fact that it may or may not work. If we say something as fact, it needs to be fact – if we say it as a suggestion or something to try, it doesn't need to work 100% of the time.
