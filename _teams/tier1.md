As our first line of support, you're the first face that our customers see – and often the only people from PIA that our customers talk to. Our job in Tier 1 is to make sure that incoming tickets get solved, or get to where they need to go to get resolved.


## Our Role

T1 is about solving customer issues. Our job is to take customer queries and ensure they get resolved or that they get to the right place they need to go to get resolved. While doing so, we report any trends to our supervisor so management can investigate them further.

We're the public face of PIA, and the ones that respond to the majority of customer queries about us and our service.


## Our Responsibilities

We have two main roles: Solving / Routing Tickets; and Escalating Trends / Issues. Here, we give a rough overview of those roles and how to go about them.


### Solving Tickets

We should be able to solve most queries that come into support ourselves. Most of them relate to things like not receiving signup emails, having minor install issues or similar.

With (hopefully!) sufficient training through this site and in-person, you should be able to solve most of the queries that come in for PIA. You can also ask your coworkers for assistance here.

For advice on approaching tickets, take a look at the CS training on the left nav bar – this should give you a good overview of how to approach a query and work out how to respond to it. After this, take a look at the specific training sections which should fill you in on each type of ticket that we encounter and how to respond to them.


### Routing Tickets

There are tickets which we can't solve ourselves. These are queries that are either too in-depth / complex, should be handled by another team, or that have gone through too much back-and-forth with no resolution. In cases like these we need to send the tickets to another team.

Let's go through each sort of ticket, and how to handle it.

#### Too In-Depth or Complex

These sorts of tickets typically require things like in-depth technical resolution. Things like custom Linux script setups, investigating custom router setups and those sort of issues.

With these tickets, reach out to your supervisor and see whether the ticket should be escalated to Tier 2. If it should be escalated, let the user know that their ticket is going to our advanced technical support team and assign it to the Tier 2 group.

#### Another Team (Business Dev, Media)

These sort of tickets include things like affiliate requests, media requests (from journalists / reporters / podcasters), business inquiries (people who wish to cooperate with PIA on product launches, develop new products / software with us, and similar), and legal inquiries.

Generally, these tickets can simply be directed towards the appropriate team, but you should get confirmation before redirecting it. Here's how we like to handle each of these kind of tickets:

- Affiliate Requests: If you encounter these type of tickets, reach out to your supervisor to see whether we should handle them ourselves or direct them to the affiliate team. If they should be handled by the affiliate team, we can direct the user to email [affiliate@privateinternetaccess.com](mailto:affiliate@privateinternetaccess.com)
- Business Development: If you encounter these type of tickets, you should post them in the `#tier1` channel and mention `@briankang`. If it should be directed towards the business development team, either they'll respond to the ticket or we can direct the user to email [businessdev@privateinternetaccess.com](mailto:businessdev@privateinternetaccess.com)
- Legal: If you encounter these type of tickets, reach out to your supervisor to see whether they are actual legal inquiries that should be handled by the legal team, or whether we're able to handle them ourselves. If they should be handled by the legal team, we can direct the user to email [legal@privateinternetaccess.com](mailto:legal@privateinternetaccess.com)
- Media (journalists / reporters / podcasters): If you encounter these type of tickets, you should direct them towards `@briankang` in Slack. That is, post the ticket in the `#tier1` channel and mention their handle.


### Escalating Trends and Issues

While answering tickets, you may notice things that it'd be good for management to know. Things like _"Hey, there's a lot of Paypal payments failing today"_, or _"The PIA website is down"_. Here, we go over some of these trends and issues which you could notice, and how they should be reported / escalated.

#### Escalating Trends

Trends are generally things that you see get worse over time. Things that we consider trends include:

- A large number of automatic refunds happening.
- A large number of payments failing.
- A large number of signup emails failing to send.
- Lots of users failing to connect to a certain region / set of servers.
- Lots of users running into issues using our app after a Windows/OSX/iOS update.

If you notice issues like this, ask a few of your coworkers whether they're seeing the same thing. If they are, make sure that T2 takes a look at the issue so they can investigate and bring it to the attention of management.

#### Escalating Issues

Issues are things you see that are definitely incorrect. Things we consider issues include:

- A gateway being completely down and unpingable.
- A link on the PIA website going nowhere.
- The LTM website being down.
- The PIA website, blog or forum being down.

When you see these sorts of issues, make sure your coworkers can see the same issue. After you've confirmed it's not just your machine having trouble, report it to your supervisor – they'll alert management to the issue and get it resolved.
