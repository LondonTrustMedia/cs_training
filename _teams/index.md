There are a number of different teams in support that handle different areas, each with their own roles and responsibilities.

This should give you a rough overview to how the teams are laid out.


## Overview

As T1, you should have a reasonably strong understanding of tech in general, generic troubleshooting, and how to deal with account/billing tickets. Being able to use Windows, Mac and Linux comfortably is useful, since our customers use all sorts of systems.

As T2, you should have the above, as well as some more in-depth knowledge on how computers work, how VPNs do their thing, and a good overview of routers/networking. Honestly, the more you know, the more you're able to help out your team and the wider variety of things you get to work on, so knowing more isn't a bad thing here at all.

Tech QA are the ones that test our apps and make sure they work successfully. QA's job is twofold – to test new versions of our app that come from the development team, and to now-and-then check out specific app bugs that T2 brings to them.

The training team are the ones that help make sure our team is up to the level they should be, in terms of knowledge and skills. Trainers keep the training sites up-to-date, run surveys on what we need to work on, run training courses and help our agents improve in general so they can provide better service to our customers. Agent QA works pretty closely with training – the role of the agent QA team is to keep an eye on our agents, see where they're at and identify they can improve.

Let's go over each team in a bit more depth.


### Tier 1

Tier 1 is the front-line of our support. The people in this group are the first, and often the only, people that our customers interact when they're having trouble. As such, it's important that we do our best to solve customers' issues accurately and without a delay that's too large.

There are three main aspects of Tier 1 work. Those are Account, Payment, and Tech. In Tier 1 these are combined, so most people should know how to handle all three types of tickets. It's fine to specialise, but being able to handle everything is necessary.

Account and Billing are more process-based, whereas Tech is more based around approaching each situation cleanly with a decent base of knowledge built up. The training sites we've got linked in the navigation menu to the left go over each of these areas in more detail.


### Tier 2

The Tier 2 team is where things go if they need a bit more knowledge / expertise / etc than the tier 1 team can provide, and double-check responses before they go public to ensure the technical content of them is accurate.

There are two types of T2 teams – CS (Retention) and Tech. The T2 CS side is more comfortable and focused on how to write well-formed and nice responses. The T2 Tech side is more comfortable and focused on having comprehensive knowledge on a set of hardware, software and operating systems that we run into a fair bit (as well as being able to investigate new things that come up fairly often).

Together, the T2 teams work to help retain our customers that have run into more trouble than they should've, as well as help support those customers with more in-depth technical issues.


### Tech QA

The Tech QA team makes sure our app is good for the general public to use. Through a combo of different testing methods and techniques, they find bugs, suggest solutions, and test strange behaviour with our app in general.

QA generally works for and with the development team. However, they also check out strange behaviour and more specific bugs that are brought up from the T2 Tech team (and if they do find bugs, pass them on to the developers to fix).


### Training

You're currently reading some materials made by the training team! We're a technical company, we have some very technical focuses and the technology we use is constantly changing. As such, we need to be constantly learning new things, reviewing old concepts/knowledge and making sure that our team has the knowledge and skills to do their thing.

Training encompases a lot, but the general gist is to make sure that we know what we're talking about. Once we know we're on the ball, we can produce materials that are accurate and clearly convey the required info for everyone to do their jobs. This includes general technical knowledge, specific account/billing flowcharts, other forms of documentation, and running training/coaching classes as appropriate.
